Jiggy Crack is a utility I wrote to create dictionary files that will crack the default passwords of select wireless gateways. If it is the default SSID and password, it will be cracked 100% of the time. It is for educational purposes only and not intended for networks other than your own.
You will need the crunch utility installed and in your $PATH as well.

It supports the following wireless gateways:
Arris DG860
Arris TG1672
Motorola Surfboard SBG6580 (Devices with a SSID of SBG650..., not newer devices with a SSID of MOTOROLA-...)
Ubee DDW365
Ubee DVW3201
Belkin router models with the SSIDs of belkin.xxx or Belkin.XXXX
Technicolor TC8717T
